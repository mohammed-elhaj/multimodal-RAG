# Ashraq Communication Strategy RAG Agent

This project is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent that provides an intelligent Q&A experience for any provided PDF document. The system uses a Streamlit web interface and automatically displays relevant page images alongside its AI-generated answers.

The entire system is powered by **LangChain** and **OpenAI's GPT-4o** model.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Zero-Setup Q&A**: Simply add a PDF and run the app. No manual indexing is required.
-   **Intelligent Q&A**: Ask complex questions and receive accurate, context-aware answers generated by GPT-4o.
-   **Source-Cited Responses**: All answers explicitly cite the page numbers from the document they used to formulate the response.
-   **Automatic Image Display**: The system displays the actual document pages that were cited, providing crucial visual context for diagrams, charts, and tables.
-   **Bring Your Own Document**: The user provides the source PDF, ensuring private documents are not stored in the public repository.

## 🏗️ How It Works: The "Smart Start" Architecture

The application is designed for maximum ease of use. When you run `streamlit run app.py`:

1.  **It Checks for a Knowledge Base:** The application first looks for a local vector database (`chroma_db/`).
2.  **Automatic Ingestion (If Needed):** If the database does not exist, the application will automatically find the PDF in the `data/` folder and run a one-time ingestion process in the background. You will see status updates directly in the app. This process:
    a. Converts each page of the PDF into a high-quality PNG image.
    b. Extracts the text from each page.
    c. Uses OpenAI's embedding model to create vectors for each page's content.
    d. Builds a local, persistent ChromaDB vector store.
3.  **Launches the RAG Agent:** Once the knowledge base is ready (either found or newly created), the interactive chat interface loads, and you can begin asking questions.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   An OpenAI API Key.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd ashraq-rag-agent
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it (on macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Or on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Your API Key**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    ```

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Add Your Document

Place the PDF document you wish to query inside the **`data/`** folder. For this task, you should use the PDF provided in the interview email.

*(Note: The `data` folder is included in the `.gitignore` to ensure your private documents are never accidentally committed.)*

### Step 2: Launch the Streamlit Application

That's it! There is **no separate indexing step.** Simply run the main application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser will automatically open. If this is the first time you're running the app with this PDF, it will perform the one-time data processing and indexing, showing you the progress. Afterward, the chat interface will appear, ready for your questions.

## 💡 Example Questions

-   "What are the main competitive advantages outlined in the document?"
-   "Show me the methodology for the communication strategy."
-   "What were the key findings from the benchmarking analysis?"
-   "What challenges are impacting visibility and engagement?"
